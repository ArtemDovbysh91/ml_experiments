# ml_experiments
This repository contains a collection of machine learning experiments implemented using the fast.ai library, which is based on the PyTorch framework. Each experiment is a combination of concepts and techniques from the courses available at the https://course.fast.ai/.

## Experiment 1: Beer or Bear?
Experiment 1 aims to distinguish between images containing beers and bears. While this might sound like a fun and quirky experiment, it serves as a foundation for understanding how to create an image classifier using Fast.ai.

This experiment has a Kaggle link with a cloud equivalent [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/artemdovbysh/exp-1-beer-or-bear)
